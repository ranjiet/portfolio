# Proximity Based Search

**Role:** CRM Solutions Architect
**Tools:** Zoho CRM, Deluge, Radial Link, Custom Functions & UI Components
**Date:** May 2025

## Context

After the success of the **Radial Link** architecture — which introduced county-level intelligence and coordinate mapping to Zoho CRM — a new business need emerged.

The sales team wanted the ability to **search for growers or accounts within a certain distance of any location**, directly inside the CRM. This capability was critical for planning in-person visits, organizing demos, identifying potential leads near existing customers, and managing localized outreach campaigns.

With no built-in spatial search tools available in Zoho, the challenge was to **transform static geographic data into actionable proximity intelligence**, entirely using Deluge and custom logic.

---
## Challenge
1. **No native radius search** — Zoho CRM cannot perform coordinate-based distance calculations
2. **Large datasets** — Thousands of records had to be scanned efficiently for proximity matching
3. **User-friendly experience** — The solution needed to run seamlessly from a button click or workflow without requiring technical inputs
4. **Accuracy vs. performance** — Calculations had to balance speed and precision for practical usability

## Solution: Turning Radial Link Into a Search Engine

Building on the **Radial Link** module’s latitude/longitude and territory data, I developed a **Proximity Search Engine** within Zoho CRM — effectively giving the system real-time spatial lookup capabilities.
### Core Components
- **Coordinate Repository (Radial Link):** used stored latitude and longitude data as a spatial reference layer for every record
- **Haversine Distance Formula:** implemented the mathematical formula in Deluge to calculate distance between two coordinate pairs, giving accurate proximity results in miles or kilometers
- **Custom Search Interface:** added a user-triggered function that accepts a ZIP code or record ID and desired radius. The system returns a list of nearby records ranked by distance
- **Result Storage:** each query logs its output in a related subform or to a potentially linked module, enabling easy retrieval and follow-up
- **Cross-Module Support:** designed the function to work across Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Deals, maintaining consistent logic and field references

---
### Example Flow
1. A GSM selects an Account and clicks **“Find Nearby Leads”**  
2. The system retrieves that Account’s coordinates from Radial Link
3. The Haversine function compares those coordinates against all Leads in the CRM
4. Results within the defined radius are displayed in an easy-to-browse list with distance values and ownership details

This turned Zoho CRM into a **self-contained geo-spatial query engine**, allowing users to visualize and act on geographic proximity without any external tools.

## Relationship to Prior Work
This capability represents the *culmination* of the previous two projects:
- **County-Level Territory Assignment** gave every record accurate geographic metadata
- **Data Integrity Framework** ensured those fields were consistent across all modules

---
## Impact  
- Introduced **radius-based discovery** capabilities for the first time in the organization’s CRM
- Empowered GSMs to identify local growth opportunities quickly
- Simplified event planning and territory optimization through better geographic context
- Reduced dependency on spreadsheets or third-party mapping tools
- Built upon the Radial Link framework, proving its scalability for advanced spatial functions

---
## Future Possibilities
The Proximity Engine laid the groundwork for a new layer of CRM intelligence — one that merges geography with sales strategy.
### Potential Enhancements  
- **Map Visualization Layer:** embed CRM data into a visual interface (e.g., Zoho Canvas or an internal dashboard) to plot results dynamically
- **Multi-Tier Radius Filters:** allow users to segment results by zones (e.g., within 25, 50, 100 miles) for better planning
- **Automated Cluster Detection:** use proximity data to identify high-density regions of activity or opportunity
- **Mobile-First Integration:** extend search capability to Zoho’s mobile app, allowing GSMs to find nearby growers on the go
- **Route Optimization:** combine proximity results with time or distance APIs to suggest the most efficient visit routes
- **Cross-System Sharing:** sync proximity data with external analytics or marketing platforms to enable geo-targeted campaigns

Each enhancement could expand CRM from a static repository into a **geospatial decision-support tool**, fully powered by internal logic.
